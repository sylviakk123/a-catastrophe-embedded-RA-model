# a-catastrophe-embedded-RA-model

The simulation model is created with the software Anylogic 6.5. There are two models in this repository, the RA model is the simulation model of the original relative agreement model, the catastrophe model is the simualtion model of the catastrophe embedded RA model. In the original RA model, employee not only updates opinion value but also uncertainty value. In the catastrophe model, the opinion uncertainty value is updated using the cusp catastrophe model.
